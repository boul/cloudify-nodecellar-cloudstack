cloudify-nodecellar-cloudstack
==============================
A sample Cloudify 3 blueprint for CloudStack, consisted of a nodejs server and mongodb database.  The sample nodejs application used here is the [nodecellar](http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/10/nodecellar-sample-application-with-backbone-js-twitter-bootstrap-node-js-express-and-mongodb/), but it could have been any other application for that matter.
